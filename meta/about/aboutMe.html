I am passionate about design in all its shapes and sizes. Iâ€™ve made things ranging from hovercraft to robots, websites to games, language frameworks to ui frameworks, all the way up to security applications and 4D imaging tools for power plants. I love to learn new things that allow me to look at the world in different and imaginative ways.
