I am passionate about design in all its shapes and sizes. I’ve made things ranging from hovercraft to robots, websites to games, language frameworks to ui frameworks, all the way up to security applications and 4D imaging tools for power plants. I love to learn new things that allow me to look at the world in different and imaginative ways.

Right now, I'm enjoying working as a developer for a startup called <a href="https://powern.ai/">PowerN</a> and I'm in the process of starting my own company named Ottery!
